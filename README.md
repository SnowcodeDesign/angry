## ‚öíÔ∏è Usage

built with vanilla html, css, and js. very easy to extend and understand. all necessary files are in the `dist/` folder and prefixed with `angry_`. the most essential file to expand upon is the `angry_caption_texts.js` which supplies the underlying "gameplay" data:

```js
/**
 * JSON representation of the ANGER level.
 * Once the max level is reached, the text will be stuck there, but the sfx will continue to be played each click.
 * If the user clicks to play the next sfx before the previous is completed, a preset record scratch sound will play.
 * Note: no sfx can be played for the first item (before user click).
 * Currently controls:
 * - text (that shows in caption & site title)
 * - fontWeight (200, 300, 400, or 700)
 * - shakiness (x/10 amount of seconds)
 * - sfx (name of audio track, cryTwo, cryThree, soAnger, or frustration)
 * - gif (name of gif or compatible <img> track, filename from /gif/ directory)
