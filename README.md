## ‚öíÔ∏è Usage

built with vanilla html, css, and js. very easy to extend and understand. all necessary files are in the `dist/` folder and prefixed with `angry_`. the most essential file to expand upon is the `angry_caption_texts.js` which supplies the underlying "gameplay" data:

```js
const ANGRY_CAPTION_TEXTS = {
    
    /* JSON for Anger Level: Caption it Displays */
    /* Once the max level is reached, the text will be stuck there */

    0: {
        text: "am i angry?",
        fontWeight: 200,
        shakiness: 0
    },
    1: {
        text: "oh angry, much?",
        fontWeight: 300,
        shakiness: 1
    },
    2: {
        text: "you're angry.",
        fontWeight: 300,
        shakiness: 2
    },
    3: {
        text: "ok, very angry?",
        fontWeight: 400,
        shakiness: 3
    },
    4: {
        text: "confirmed: super angry",
        fontWeight: 400,
        shakiness: 6
    },
    5: {
        text: "red alert red alert how angry can you get",
        fontWeight: 700,
        shakiness: 8
    },
    6: {

        fontWeight: 400,

    },
    9: {
        text: " ",
        fontWeight: 400,
